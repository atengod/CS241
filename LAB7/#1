total no. of people = 100
total no. of females = 60

a)
prob of selecting female = (total no. of females / total no. of people)
= 60 / 100 
= 0.6

b)
total no. of A = 17
total no. of O = 36
prob of selectig a person either A or O = (total no. of A + total no. of O / total no. of people)
= 17 + 36 / 100
= 0.53

c)
total no. of AB = 7 + 23 =30
total male of AB = 7
= 7 / 30
= 0.23
