a)
k pair of shoes = 2k shoes in a bag
2 complete pair removed (n) = 4 shoes
k1n + 1 = 2k
k1n = 2k - 1
k1 = (2k - 1) / n
k1 = (2k - 1) / 4
no. of shoes = k1 + 1
= [(2k - 1) / 4] + 1
= (2k - 1 + 4) / 4
= (2k + 3) / 4


b)


c)


d)
total people = 25
kn + 1 = 25
kn = 25 -1
kn = 24
born in same month n = 12
k * 12 = 24
k = 24 / 12
k = 2
people born in same month = k + 1
= 2 + 1
= 3
