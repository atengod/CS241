a)
outfit combinations = 3 * 5 * 4 + 1 + 1
=62

 
b)
total certificates = 12 * 5 * 10
= 600


c)
= 4 + 30 + 3
= 37

n(B) = (6*5) + (6*1) + (5*4)
= 30 + 6 + 20
= 56

possible combinations = [n(A) + n (B)] - [n(Aâˆ©B)]
= 37 + 56 - 13
= 80
//2 out of 6 mean = 6 * 6-1 -> these two are selected


d)
binary string of length 8
Palindromes are reversible string. So 8 length = 8/2 = 4 bit used and will be used to reverse 
n = 4
no. of binary strings = 2^n
= 2^4
= 16
