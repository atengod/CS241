1. Diligent people succeed. No quitter succeeds. Some quitters, however, are content. Therefore, no
quitter is diligent.

Let D(x) = x is diligent people 
Q(x) = x is quitter
S(x) = x is succeed
C(x) = x is content

Predicate WFF: ∀x [D(x) -> S(x)] ^ ∀x[D(x) -> S(x)]' -> Ǝx[Q(x) ^ C(x)] -> ∀x[Q(x) -> D(x)]'

∈ X P(x) ∈ Y Ǝy ∈ Y Q(y) ∈ Z -> Ǝx ∈ X (x ∈ Z) 
PROOF:

2. Rational numbers are real numbers. All integers are rational numbers. Hence, some real numbers
are integers.

Let R(x) = x is rational numbers
N(x) = x is real numbers
I(x) = x is integers

Predicate WFF: ∀x [R(x) -> N(x)] ^ ∀x [I(x) -> R(x)] -> Ǝx[N(x) ^ I(x)]

PROOF:
by universal specification
by hypothetical syllogism
by existential generalization

3. There is a writer who is not nearsighted. Everyone who wears glasses is nearsighted. Furthermore,
everyone either wears glasses or wears contact lenses. Therefore, some writer wears contact lenses.

Let W(x) = x is writer
N(x) = x is nearsighted
G(x) = x is wears glasses
C(x) = x is wears contact lenses

Predicate WFF:

PROOF:
by universal specification
by simplification
by contrapositive rule
by modus ponen
by disjunctive syllogism
by conjunction
by existential generalization

4. Software engineers are both mathematicians and designers. Mathematicians are analytical. Designers
are analytical as well. Hence, Software engineers are analytical.
 Let S(x) = x is software engineers
 M(x) = x is mathematicians
 D(x) = x is designers
 A(x) = x is analytical 
 
Predicate WFF: ∀x[S(x) -> M(x) ^ D(x)] ^ ∀x [M(x) -> A(x)] [D(x)->A(x)] -> [S(x) -> A(x)]

PROOF:
by universal generalization
by hypothetical syllogism 
by universal generalization

5. To qualify as a citizen of a state for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, a party must currently reside
in that state and intend to remain there indefinitely. Here, the plaintiff does not currently reside
in the state. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot be a citizen of the state for jurisdictional purposes.

Let Q(x) = x is qualify to be citizen of state
R(x) = x is currently reside in state

predicate wff: ∀x(Q(x) -> R(x))

PROOF:
by universal specification
by contrpositive rule
by modus ponen
