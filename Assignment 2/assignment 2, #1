a)
DOI = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
P(x) -> x/2 is odd, x  ∈ DOI, x/2 is odd, therefore P is true
Q(x) -> 4 divides x, but 4 does not divide 2, hence Q is false
Thus P(x) -> Q(x) is false

b)
DOI = Dx * Dy = {{1,3,5} * {2,4,6}} = {(1,2), (1,4), (1,6), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6)}
If G(x, y) -> x < y, G(x, y) = {(1,2),(1,4),(1,6),(3,4),(3,6),(5,6)}
For each x, y = 6 works as 1 < 6,3 < 6,5 < 6
So if G(x, y) -> x < y for ∀x ∃y G(x, y) ∨ G(y, x) is true
